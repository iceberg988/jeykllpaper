1. In the GitHub repository settings, specify your Google domain name to serve the GitHub pages.

2. Go to Google Domains DNS view, create an [A record](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider) and CNAME entry to point your Google domain at your web server.

   To verify the DNS record configured correctly, use the dig command to confirm the results match the IP addresses for GitHub Pages above.

   ```
   $ dig flamingbytes.com +noall +answer
   ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> flamingbytes.com +noall +answer
   ;; global options: +cmd
   flamingbytes.com.	3600	IN	A	185.199.110.153
   flamingbytes.com.	3600	IN	A	185.199.108.153 
   flamingbytes.com.	3600	IN	A	185.199.109.153
   flamingbytes.com.	3600	IN	A	185.199.111.153
   ```   

   To verify the CNAME record configured corretly, use the dig command to check as the following.

   ```
   $ dig www.flamingbytes.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
   ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> www.flamingbytes.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
   ;; global options: +cmd
   ;www.flamingbytes.com.		IN	A
   www.flamingbytes.com.	3406	IN	CNAME	iceberg988.github.io.
   iceberg988.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.108.153
   iceberg988.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.110.153
   iceberg988.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.109.153
   iceberg988.github.io.	3600	IN	A	185.199.111.153
   ```
